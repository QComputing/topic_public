  <title>Physical Implementation (Topics Group 19 Quantum Computing)</title>
</head>
<body>
In the past 10 years substantial work has been made towards making quantum computers a reality. To achieve this,
research teams across the world have been trying to find the most viable way of representing qubits, or 
<i>quantum bits</i>, using physical phenomena. This is similar to how the binary digits 0 and 1 can be 
represented in modern semiconductors by electricity either flowing or not flowing through the material.</br>
</br>
There are several fields of research in attempting to develop a way of representing qubits. Amongst these, the
four most notable are superconductivity, trapped ions, topological quantum computers, and quantum optics. Each 
of these fields has attracted research teams hopeful that they can develop a way of using that phenomena to 
produce a quantum computer, and trying to produce the hardware needed for these a computer built by these means.
Here we will discuss what some of these requirements are, the differences between these four main approaches for
representing qubits, and the prospect that each of them has for being used in future quantum computers.</br>
</br>
<b>Superconducting Quantum Computing</b></br>
</br>
Normal conductors are made up of charge carriers that allow current to flow through the material. In metals 
charge carriers are individual electrons. Ultimately no quantum effects are observed because individual 
electrons interfere with each other.</br>
By contrast, charge carriers in superconductors are pairs of electrons rather than single electrons. The spin 
of electrons in these pairs form bosons that form Bose-Einstein Condensates, a state of matter where bosons can
occupy a single quantum energy level, and so as a result the electron pairs in superconductors can have their 
flow described by a probability amplitude function that can have complex values, while in normal conductors due
to interference quantum effects because of this are not observable.</br>
Various companies and research teams view superconducting properties to be the leading method for building and 
developing quantum computers. Google, IBM, and research teams at various universities have placed resources 
into researching and developing quantum computers in this way. Through this approach [successes?]</br>
One notable challenge to this approach is its requirement for extremely efficient cooling in order to reach 
temperatures low enough for superconductivity to occur. However, with breakthroughs in chemicals research in 
recent years as well, the required temperatures to achieve observable superconductivity has gradually become 
less strict, with the prospect of improving in future with the discovery of new materials.</br>
</br>
<b>Ion-Based Quantum Computing</b></br>
</br>
This approach uses charged particles in order to perform calculations in quantum time. Trapped ion quantum 
computers are one example of these computers, in which qubits are stored within the ions’ electronic states. 
Lasers allow qubits to become entangled with each other, and information can be transferred by charge 
interaction following Coulomb’s law.</br>
So far quantum computing operations have been successfully performed using trapped ion systems. As a result, 
they have become one of the major areas of research for achieving quantum computing, and one of the most 
promising, where as of May 2011 up to 14 trapped ions have been controllably entangled.</br>
</br>
<b>Spin-Based Quantum Computing</b></br>
</br>
This form of quantum computing comes in various forms, including approaches using trapped ions, and others 
using ultracold atoms. The principle behind both of these is the property of spin possessed by molecules, atoms,
and subatomic particles to represent qubits.</br>
[find more data on this. Also note that it seems relatively unused and unresearched.]</br>
</br>
<b>Quantum Optics</b></br>
</br>
Another fairly popular area of research in quantum computing is quantum optics, which works using light’s 
interaction with matter. Photons demonstrate entanglement, teleportation, and logic gates. As each atom carries
energy according to the formula E = hf (h is the Planck constant; f is the photon’s frequency of vibration) and
light emitted from atoms will only have certain quanta of energy, light’s quantum properties allow it to be
used for building quantum computer hardware.</br>
Quantum optics is an area of active research, both for quantum computing and as research into information 
theory. However, research into quantum optics is relatively recent, and so producing quantum computers by this 
method, as with others, remains a challenge for researchers and engineers.</br>
</br>
<b>Topological Quantum Computers</b></br>
</br>
Topological quantum computers are a theoretical model for developing quantum computers build off anyons, 
2-dimensional particles that have their world lines (a particle’s locus through spacetime) intertwine in 
3-dimensional space to form what are called braids. In topological quantum computers, logic gates are made up 
by the braids of anyons.</br>
This type of quantum computing is theoretically attractive because it has higher stability in having its state 
changed relative to using trapped quantum particles such as electrons and photons. Operations on braids are 
either performed as changes in the topological phase of the anions, or as rotation of anions within space.</br>
As of yet, little progress has been made towards designing real topological quantum computers in practice. In 
particular, research on using anions is relatively unexplored, and one type of anyon, non-abelian anyons, are 
yet to be observed.</br>
</br>
The various suggested theoretical and practical approaches that are being taken to develop quantum computers are
each unique in their strengths and challenges. In recent years, the theoretical developments made towards 
realizing quantum computers has been assisted in great part by a better understanding of physics, and while the
most significant challenge faced by modern quantum computing research teams is an engineering and theoretical
one in figuring out how to make them, the prospects of successfully building one in the oncoming years look 
promising.
