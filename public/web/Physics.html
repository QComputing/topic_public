                    The Physics Of Quantum Computing
		</h1>

		<p>
		In the past 10 years substantial work has been made towards
		making quantum computers a reality. To achieve this, research
		teams across the world have been trying to find the most viable
		way of representing qubits, or <i>quantum bits</i>, using
		physical phenomena. This is similar to how the binary digits 0
		and 1 can be represented in modern semiconductors by
		electricity either flowing or not flowing through the material.
		<br />
                </p>
                <br />
                <p>
		There are several fields of research in attempting to develop a
		way of representing qubits. Amongst these, the four most
		notable are superconductivity, trapped ions, topological
		quantum computers, and quantum optics. Each of these fields has
		attracted research teams hopeful that they can develop a way of
		using that phenomena to produce a quantum computer, and trying
		to produce the hardware needed for these a computer built by
		these means. Here we will discuss what some of these
		requirements are, the differences between these four main
		approaches for representing qubits, and the prospect that each
		of them has for being used in future quantum computers.
		<br />
                </p>
                <br />
                <h2>Superconducting Quantum Computing</h2>
                <p>
		Normal conductors are made up of charge carriers that allow
		current to flow through the material. In metals charge carriers
		are individual electrons. Ultimately no quantum effects are
		observed because individual electrons interfere with each other.
		<br />
		</p>
                <p>
                By contrast, charge carriers in superconductors are pairs of
		electrons rather than single electrons. The spin of electrons
		in these pairs form bosons that form Bose-Einstein Condensates,
		a state of matter where bosons can occupy a single quantum
		energy level, and so as a result the electron pairs in
		superconductors can have their flow described by a probability
		amplitude function that can have complex values, while in
		normal conductors due to interference quantum effects because
		of this are not observable.
		<br />
		</p>
                <p>
                Various companies and research teams view superconducting
		properties to be the leading method for building and developing
		quantum computers. Google,<sup>[1]</sup> IBM,<sup>[2]</sup> and
		private research companies Rigetti<sup>[3]</sup> and Quantum
		Circuits<sup>[3]</sup> have all placed resources into
		developing quantum computers in this way. Through this approach
		it has been theoretically suggested that this may enable
		quantum error correction on devices that use it. Google’s
		superconducting devices have also been successful in showing
		the ability to solve special types of quantum problems that
		allow them to simulate scenarios such as the interactions
		between many elections, called <i>non-stoquastic problems.</i>
		<sup>[1]</sup>
		<br />
                </p>
                <p>
                One notable challenge to this approach is its requirement for
		extremely efficient cooling in order to reach temperatures low
		enough for superconductivity to occur. However, with modern
		cryogenic technologies such as <i>dilution refrigerators</i>, a
		type of refrigerator that uses a mix of <sup>3</sup>He and
		<sup>4</sup>He to achieve temperatures as low as a few
		millikelvin<sup>[4]</sup>, the temperatures needed to achieve
		superconductivity have become realistically achievable. More
		problematic than this is that in quantum computers computation
		can only be performed while its coherence is maintained, and
		therefore the decoherence time must be sufficiently long.

                <h2>Ion-Based Quantum Computing</h2>

                <p>
                    This approach uses charged particles in order to perform
		    calculations in quantum time. Trapped ion quantum computers
		    are one example of these computers, in which qubits are
		    stored within the ions’ electronic states. Lasers allow
		    qubits to become entangled with each other, and information
		    can be transferred by charge interaction following
		    Coulomb’s law.<br />
                    So far quantum computing operations have been successfully
		    performed using trapped ion systems. As a result, they have
		    become one of the major areas of research for achieving
		    quantum computing, and one of the most promising, where as
		    of May 2011 up to 14 trapped ions have been controllably
		    entangled.<sup>[7]</sup><br />
		    However, this approach has difficulties with scalability.
		    The main problem with scalability lies in performing
		    multiple-qubit operations. To do these, ions need to form
		    a chain, but as size increases the coupling between each
		    ion gets weaker. This causes problems for larger numbers of
		    qubits within ion-trap quantum computers.<sup>[8]</sup>
		    <br />
		    This approach has proved quite promising from an engineering
		    perspective, one such example being the milestone of
		    successful 14-qubit implementation. Even so, many problems
		    remain to be overcome regarding scalability before this
		    approach can be used more effectively. <br />

		    <a href="Logic.html">
			    <i>implementation page.</i>
		    </a>
		    <br />
                </p>
                <br />

		<h2>Quantum Optics</h2>

                <p>
                    Another popular area of research in quantum computing is
		    quantum optics, which works using the interaction of light
		    with matter. Photons display entanglement, teleportation,
		    and can be transformed by quantum logic gates. As each atom
		    carries energy according to the formula E = hf (h is the
		    Planck constant; f is the photon’s frequency of vibration)
		    and light emitted from atoms will only have certain quanta
		    of energy, light’s quantum properties allow it to be used
		    for building quantum computer hardware.<br />
		    The major benefit of this approach is that photons are
		    largely unaffected by noise, and so are far less severely
		    affected by decoherence<sup>[9]</sup>. Because quantum
		    calculations can only occur during times of coherence, this
		    is a massively important property in quantum optics.
		    Furthermore, qubits represented by photons can be
		    faithfully transmitted between specified
		    locations.<sup>[10]</sup><br />
		    Despite this, this transmission is only reliable up to
		    1 km. Another significant disadvantage is that photons do
		    not interact with each other, as is normally needed for a
		    quantum computer.<sup>[11]</sup><br />
		    Overall, this approach is promising from a theoretical
		    perspective, and especially attractive because they are
		    so weakly affected by decoherence. But due to the
		    significant problem of photons not interacting with each
		    other, it may face problems being properly implemented to
		    make a quantum computer in future compared to other
		    alternative methods. <br />

                <h2>Topological Quantum Computers</h2>

                <p>
                    Topological quantum computers are a theoretical model for
		    developing quantum computers build off anyons,
		    2-dimensional particles that have their world lines (a
		    particle’s locus through spacetime) intertwine in
                    3-dimensional space to form what are called braids. In
		    topological quantum computers, logic gates are made up by
		    the braids of anyons.<br />
                    This type of quantum computing is theoretically attractive
		    because it has higher stability in having its state changed
		    relative to using trapped quantum particles such as
		    electrons and photons<sup>[12]</sup>. Operations on braids
		    are either performed as changes in the topological phase of
		    the anions, or as rotation of anions within space.<br />
                    As of yet, designing real topological computers in practice
		    has proved difficult. Although this research has the
		    support from Microsoft research teams, research on using
		    anions is relatively unexplored compared to other methods
		    listed on this page other than from a mostly theoretical
		    perspective. This is because as of 2013, non-abelian anyons
		    had not been experimentally observed. [13]<br />
		    Below is a video briefly outlining the principles behind
		    topological quantum computing.<br />
                    <br />
