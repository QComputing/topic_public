                </h1>
                <p>In the past 10 years substantial work has been made towards making quantum computers a reality. To achieve this, research teams across the world have been trying to find the most viable way of representing qubits, or
                    <i>quantum bits</i>, using physical phenomena. This is similar to how the binary digits 0 and 1 can be
                    represented in modern semiconductors by electricity either flowing or not flowing through the material.<br />
                </p>
                <br />
                <p>
                    There are several fields of research in attempting to develop a way of representing qubits. Amongst these, the
                    four most notable are superconductivity, trapped ions, topological quantum computers, and quantum optics. Each
                    of these fields has attracted research teams hopeful that they can develop a way of using that phenomena to
                    produce a quantum computer, and trying to produce the hardware needed for these a computer built by these means.
                    Here we will discuss what some of these requirements are, the differences between these four main approaches for
                    representing qubits, and the prospect that each of them has for being used in future quantum computers.<br />
                </p>
                <br />
                <h2>Superconducting Quantum Computing</h2>
                <p>
                    Normal conductors are made up of charge carriers that allow current to flow through the material. In metals
                    charge carriers are individual electrons. Ultimately no quantum effects are observed because individual
                    electrons interfere with each other.<br /></p>
                <p>
                    By contrast, charge carriers in superconductors are pairs of electrons rather than single electrons. The spin
                    of electrons in these pairs form bosons that form Bose-Einstein Condensates, a state of matter where bosons can
                    occupy a single quantum energy level, and so as a result the electron pairs in superconductors can have their
                    flow described by a probability amplitude function that can have complex values, while in normal conductors due
                    to interference quantum effects because of this are not observable.<br /></p>
                <p>
                    Various companies and research teams view superconducting properties to be the leading method for building and
                    developing quantum computers. Google, IBM, and research teams at various universities have placed resources
                    into researching and developing quantum computers in this way. Through this approach [successes?]<br />
                </p>
                <p>
                    One notable challenge to this approach is its requirement for extremely efficient cooling in order to reach
                    temperatures low enough for superconductivity to occur. However, with breakthroughs in chemicals research in
                    recent years as well, the required temperatures to achieve observable superconductivity has gradually become
                    less strict, with the prospect of improving in future with the discovery of new materials.<br />
                </p>
                <br />
                <h2>Ion-Based Quantum Computing</h2>

                <p>
                    This approach uses charged particles in order to perform calculations in quantum time. Trapped ion quantum
                    computers are one example of these computers, in which qubits are stored within the ions’ electronic states.
                    Lasers allow qubits to become entangled with each other, and information can be transferred by charge
                    interaction following Coulomb’s law.<br />
                    So far quantum computing operations have been successfully performed using trapped ion systems. As a result,
                    they have become one of the major areas of research for achieving quantum computing, and one of the most
                    promising, where as of May 2011 up to 14 trapped ions have been controllably entangled.<br />
                </p>
                <br />

                <h2>Spin-Based Quantum Computing</h2>

                <p>
                    This form of quantum computing comes in various forms, including approaches using trapped ions, and others
                    using ultracold atoms. The principle behind both of these is the property of spin possessed by molecules, atoms,
                    and subatomic particles to represent qubits.<br />
                    [find more data on this. Also note that it seems relatively unused and unresearched.]<br />
                </p>
                <h2>Quantum Optics</h2>
                <p>
                    Another fairly popular area of research in quantum computing is quantum optics, which works using light’s
                    interaction with matter. Photons demonstrate entanglement, teleportation, and logic gates. As each atom carries
                    energy according to the formula E = hf (h is the Planck constant; f is the photon’s frequency of vibration) and
                    light emitted from atoms will only have certain quanta of energy, light’s quantum properties allow it to be
                    used for building quantum computer hardware.<br />
                    Quantum optics is an area of active research, both for quantum computing and as research into information
                    theory. However, research into quantum optics is relatively recent, and so producing quantum computers by this
                    method, as with others, remains a challenge for researchers and engineers.<br />
                </p>

                <h2>Topological Quantum Computers</h2>

                <p>
                    Topological quantum computers are a theoretical model for developing quantum computers build off anyons,
                    2-dimensional particles that have their world lines (a particle’s locus through spacetime) intertwine in
                    3-dimensional space to form what are called braids. In topological quantum computers, logic gates are made up
                    by the braids of anyons.<br />
                    This type of quantum computing is theoretically attractive because it has higher stability in having its state
                    changed relative to using trapped quantum particles such as electrons and photons. Operations on braids are
                    either performed as changes in the topological phase of the anions, or as rotation of anions within space.<br />
                    As of yet, little progress has been made towards designing real topological quantum computers in practice. In
                    particular, research on using anions is relatively unexplored, and one type of anyon, non-abelian anyons, are
                    yet to be observed.<br />
                    <br />
                    The various suggested theoretical and practical approaches that are being taken to develop quantum computers are
                    each unique in their strengths and challenges. In recent years, the theoretical developments made towards
                    realizing quantum computers has been assisted in great part by a better understanding of physics, and while the
                    most significant challenge faced by modern quantum computing research teams is an engineering and theoretical
                    one in figuring out how to make them, the prospects of successfully building one in the oncoming years look
                    promising.
