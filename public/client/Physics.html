                    The Physics Of Quantum Computing
		</h1>
		<p>In the past 10 years substantial work has been made towards making quantum 
		computers a reality. To achieve this, research teams across the world have been 
		trying to find the most viable way of representing qubits, or <i>quantum bits</i>, 
		using physical phenomena. This is similar to how the binary digits 0 and 1 can be 
		represented in modern semiconductors by electricity either flowing or not flowing 
		through the material.
		    <br />
                </p>
                <br />
                <p>
		There are several fields of research in attempting to develop a way of representing 
		qubits. Amongst these, the four most notable are superconductivity, trapped ions, 
		topological quantum computers, and quantum optics. Each of these fields has 
		attracted research teams hopeful that they can develop a way of using that phenomena 
		to produce a quantum computer, and trying to produce the hardware needed for these 
		a computer built by these means. Here we will discuss what some of these 
		requirements are, the differences between these four main approaches for 
		representing qubits, and the prospect that each of them has for being used in future 
		quantum computers.
		    <br />
                </p>
                <br />
                <h2>Superconducting Quantum Computing</h2>
                <p>
                    Normal conductors are made up of charge carriers that allow current to flow 
		    through the material. In metals charge carriers are individual electrons. 
		    Ultimately no quantum effects are observed because individual electrons 
		    interfere with each other.
		    <br />
		</p>
                <p>
                    By contrast, charge carriers in superconductors are pairs of electrons rather 
		    than single electrons. The spin of electrons in these pairs form bosons that 
		    form Bose-Einstein Condensates, a state of matter where bosons can occupy a 
		    single quantum energy level, and so as a result the electron pairs in 
		    superconductors can have their flow described by a probability amplitude 
		    function that can have complex values, while in normal conductors due to 
		    interference quantum effects because of this are not observable.
		    <br />
		</p>
                <p>
                    Various companies and research teams view superconducting properties to be the 
		    leading method for building and developing quantum computers. Google,
		    <sup>[1]</sup> IBM,<sup>[2]</sup> and private research companies Rigetti
		    <sup>[3]</sup> and Quantum Circuits<sup>[3]</sup> have all placed resources into 
		    developing quantum computers in this way. Through this approach it has been 
		    theoretically suggested that this may enable quantum error correction on devices 
		    that use it. Google’s superconducting devices have also been successful in 
		    showing the ability to solve special types of quantum problems that allow them 
		    to simulate scenarios such as the interactions between many elections, called 
		    <i>non-stoquastic problems.</i><sup>[1]</sup>
		    <br />
                </p>
                <p>
                    One notable challenge to this approach is its requirement for extremely 
		    efficient cooling in order to reach temperatures low enough for 
		    superconductivity to occur. However, with modern cryogenic technologies such as 
                    <i>dilution refrigerators</i>, a type of refrigerator that uses a mix of 
		    <sup>3</sup>He and <sup>4</sup>He to achieve temperatures as low as a few 
		    millikelvin<sup>[4]</sup>, the temperatures needed to achieve superconductivity 
		    have become realistically achievable. More problematic than this is that in 
		    quantum computers computation can only be performed while its coherence is 
		    maintained, and therefore the decoherence time must be sufficiently long.

                <h2>Ion-Based Quantum Computing</h2>

                <p>
                    This approach uses charged particles in order to perform calculations in quantum time. Trapped ion quantum
                    computers are one example of these computers, in which qubits are stored within the ions’ electronic states.
                    Lasers allow qubits to become entangled with each other, and information can be transferred by charge
                    interaction following Coulomb’s law.<br />
                    So far quantum computing operations have been successfully performed using trapped ion systems. As a result,
                    they have become one of the major areas of research for achieving quantum computing, and one of the most
                    promising, where as of May 2011 up to 14 trapped ions have been controllably entangled.<br />
                </p>
                <br />

		<h2>Quantum Optics</h2>

                <p>
                    Another fairly popular area of research in quantum computing is quantum optics, which works using light’s
                    interaction with matter. Photons demonstrate entanglement, teleportation, and logic gates. As each atom carries
                    energy according to the formula E = hf (h is the Planck constant; f is the photon’s frequency of vibration) and
                    light emitted from atoms will only have certain quanta of energy, light’s quantum properties allow it to be
                    used for building quantum computer hardware.<br />
                    Quantum optics is an area of active research, both for quantum computing and as research into information
                    theory. However, research into quantum optics is relatively recent, and so producing quantum computers by this
                    method, as with others, remains a challenge for researchers and engineers.<br />
                </p>
		<br />

                <h2>Topological Quantum Computers</h2>

                <p>
                    Topological quantum computers are a theoretical model for developing quantum computers build off anyons,
                    2-dimensional particles that have their world lines (a particle’s locus through spacetime) intertwine in
                    3-dimensional space to form what are called braids. In topological quantum computers, logic gates are made up
                    by the braids of anyons.<br />
                    This type of quantum computing is theoretically attractive because it has higher stability in having its state
                    changed relative to using trapped quantum particles such as electrons and photons. Operations on braids are
                    either performed as changes in the topological phase of the anions, or as rotation of anions within space.<br />
                    As of yet, little progress has been made towards designing real topological quantum computers in practice. In
                    particular, research on using anions is relatively unexplored, and one type of anyon, non-abelian anyons, are
                    yet to be observed.<br />

		<h2>Conclusion</h2>

		<p>
                    The various suggested theoretical and practical approaches that are being taken to develop quantum computers are
                    each unique in their strengths and challenges. In recent years, the theoretical developments made towards
                    realizing quantum computers has been assisted in great part by a better understanding of physics, and while the
                    most significant challenge faced by modern quantum computing research teams is an engineering and theoretical
                    one in figuring out how to make them, the prospects of successfully building one in the oncoming years look
                    promising.
